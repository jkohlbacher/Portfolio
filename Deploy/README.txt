A few simple scripts I wrote to simplify my work at Deploy Online. 

They use a Pipedrive API wrapper library that I found online.

Pipedrive was the primary CRM software developer that Deploy worked with.

They were for my own personal use and since I was the only one with programming experience at the company I knew I wouldn't need to share them with anyone else at the company. 
Due to this, long term maintainability or scalability were not really things I considered when making them.

The scripts in the work folder are different though and were not for personal use. They were commissioned by a former colleague of mine who continued working with several clients after the company shutdown. 
It was an interesting challenge to write a script for someone with very minimal experience reading or writing code. I had to find the right balance between making the code as simple as possible 
while also completing the required task efficiently. The goal of the scripts is to create custom fields for the Persons and Deals pages in the CRM.
